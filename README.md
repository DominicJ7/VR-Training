This repository hosts code that is part of a research paper. The provided code generates an interactive 3D scene using the A-Frame library. The scene is designed to be a VR experience where users can interact with various 3D models. As the used 3D-Models are not public, they cannot be accessed via github.

As this repository is part of an academic research paper contributions are not open. 

Overview
The code displays a 3D scene that contains a few 3D models, including a truck in two states (opened and closed), a bottle of water and an avocado. The scene also includes a plane (the base) and a sky element.
The truck, the bottle and the avocado models have associated animations and can be interacted with. There are three main buttons for interactions:
Open Button - Opens the truck;
Close Button - Closes the truck;
Reset Button - Resets the state of the scene;
The number of clicks made on the models is tracked and displayed in the scene via an info label.
